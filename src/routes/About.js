        I'm David, a media engineer from Germany. I currently live in
        BenalmÃ¡dena on the spanish Costa del Sol. I worked for every major
        tv-station in Germany and i'm still remote working for two public
        broadcasters. So i guess i'm somewhat a digital nomad ðŸ˜‰

        My experiences include video production, content development, live tv
        production and editing. I wrote and directed three documentaries on
        contemporary art and remixing. 5 years ago i rediscovered my fascination
        for programming and web development. I bootcamped in Responsive Web
        Design, React, Vue and Svelte and developed dozens of applications for
        training purposes.

        my journey with more projects from that resource. At least until i find
        something better to do ...
