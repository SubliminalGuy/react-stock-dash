        I'm a media engineer from Germany. I currently live in Benalm√°dena on
        the spanish Costa del Sol. I worked for every major tv-station in
        Germany and i'm still remote working for two public broadcaster. So i

        My experiences include video production, content development, video
        engineering and editing. 5 years ago i rediscovered my fascination for
        programming and web development. I bootcamped in React, Vue and Svelte
        and developed dozens of applications for training purposes.
